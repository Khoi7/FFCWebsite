4. KNOWN BUGS
Not actual bugs but rather drawbacks as they make the website less efficient like a real website
    - Player photos does not open a specific player info page on click (as those pages are not built yet)
    - Photos album does not leads to a self-built album page but only leads to a Facebook album which is created already

5. NOTES
Facebook and Instagram links are put as a text and not as icons on purpose. I intended to use icons like most websites how most websites are doing. However, as I researched, I found out that it will use a kind of external library (with provided link to that library), and I do not know if you allow this. Therefore I assume that it is prohibited like stated in the assignment specifications, and did not apply it, only use text for the link.
